    <h2>What is White Wine?</h2>

        <p> White wine can connote purity. White wine is a wine that is fermented without skin contact. The colour can be straw-yellow, yellow-green, or yellow-gold. It is produced by the alcoholic fermentation of the non-coloured pulp of grapes, which may have a skin of any colour. White wine has existed for at least 4000 years. White wines are made from only the fruit juice. The majority of white wines are lighter and have a crisper, more citrusy flavor compared to reds. Research shows that white wines keep lung tissues healthy. White wines generally have less alcohol and fewer calories than reds. The lighter foods are pair with the light wines. White wine is served with chicken and fish. If you are looking to pair a wine with dessert, go for the sweet wine.</p>
