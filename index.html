            <p> Welcome to my page! Ready to expand your palate! Lay your hair down and open your mind to a variety of wines. I've been into wine since for over a decade now.  My webpage is to make the not so average “wine connoisseur” comfortable in indulging in fine wines at a reasonable price. When it comes down to it, I am passionate about wine!  I am by no means a Sommelier, Wine Maker, or Vineyard Management expert, however my knowledge thus far is much greater than the average American wine consumer, and I have a strong thirst for knowledge that will allow me to bring you the most up-to-date and fascinating advances in wine. I will be posting my monthly favorites with wine from my random visits to the winery to the unique wine bars in the Detroit area. My rule is to not drink any wine with a alcohol content below 10%. It's a wino's honor. </p>
