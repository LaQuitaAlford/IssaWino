        <h2>What is Red Wine?</h2>

         <p>Red wine differs from white wine in its base material and production process. Red wine is made with dark-skinned rather than light-skinned grapes. During red wine production, the winemaker allows pressed grape juice, called must, to macerate and ferment with the dark grape skins, which adds color, flavor and tannin to the wine. When pairing wine with food, the richer, heavier food go well with the richer, heavier wines. Usually red wine is served with the red meat. Plenty of studies have shown that moderate red wine consumption is better for you than not drinking at all.

            The reason is the antioxidants found in red wine, which reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease, mortality and type 2 diabetes. If you drink more than you should, the benefits are of course replaced by increased health risks.</p>
