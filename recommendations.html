        <h2>Wine Bar of the Month: Motor City Wine</h2>

            <div class="winebar">

            </div>

            <p>Half wine bar, half wine store stocked with worldly bottles, Motor City Wine has pairings of the best things that go with the grape juice, such as cheese plates, charcuterie, and guest pop-ups. This Corktown spot makes all of their bottles available for consumption on premises for just an $8 corkage fee. Enjoy a glass while listening to live bands playing everything from jazz to motown. They also have a lovely outside patio. My favorite night to spend at this bar is when that Detroit House Music blare through the speakers on a warm evening. This bar is located at 1949 Michigan Ave, Detroit, MI 48216.</p>





        

        <h2>Wine of the Month: 19 Crimes Hard Chardonnay</h2>

            <div class="winebottle">

            </div>

            <p> White wine is the theme as we warm up outside! This is a bold expression of Chardonnay in the 19 Crimes lineup. Bold and strong in character, this deep rich and golden Chardonnay is filled with stone fruit aromas and a sweet textured palate. The criminally intense toasty oak notes have hints of butterscotch and honey balanced with layers of ripe fruit. This full bodied, powerful wine finishes with rich notes of butter and vanilla. A great value for a popular wine from Australia. This is the perfect wine to have slightly chilled on a nice Spring Day! You can find this at your nearby Meijer, Kroger, or Walmart. This bottle is no more than 12 bucks. And finally the best part! The <strong>alcohol content</strong> is 15%.  </p>

        
        <h2>Winery of the Month: Black Star Farms </h2>
        
            <div class="winery">

            </div>

            <p> Okay, I honestly don't know where to begin. This was a random trip I took to Northern Michigan during the pandemic and I do not regret this experience at all. Even though their tasting room was closed (For obvious safety reasons), I was able to order curbside service! Black Star Farms is one of Michigan’s finest wineries. Their wines are consistently excellent in both reds and whites. Black Star is an outstanding example of how Michigan has become one of the better wine producing regions of the world. Not only do they have wine, but they had the most delicious Apple Brandy I ever had! This fine establishment is located at 360 McKinley Rd E, Traverse City, MI 49686 </p>
